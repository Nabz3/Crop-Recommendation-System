# Crop-Recommendation-System

## Motivation

These days, percision agriculcture is popular. using information on soil types, characteristics, crop yields, and weather. Percision agriculture is a contemporary farming method that recommends the best crop for farmers to produce on their farms in order to maximize production and profit. This method can lower crop failure rates and assist farmers in making well- informed decisions on their agriculture approach.

Better recommendation systems are required to help farmers make well-informed decisions prior to beginning crop cultivvation, thereby mitigating the aggricultural crisis under the current status quo.

## Goals

Recommending the best crops for farmers to grow based on several parameters and assisting them in making an informed decision before cultivation.
